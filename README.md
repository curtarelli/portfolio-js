# JavaScript and Google Earth Engine (GEE) Coding Portfolio
This is a professional Portfolio of data science scripts for engineering and remote sensing applications in order to deal with environmental data fora variety of purposes.
Here one can find simple codes and complex applications write in **JavaScrip** (`.js`) in **JavaScript** and **HTML** languages.

*Image download (MSI, OLI, and others):
	* Simple GEE scripts to download L1C and L2C data;
* Data pre processing:
	* Data Frame composing and arranjement;
	* Data smoothing;
	* Data calibration;
* Time-series application:
	* Modeling and algorithm applications over time-series images;
* Graphical plots functions:
	* Canvas plot of static images and vectors for visualization;
	* GIF video-like thumbnail creations for time-series data;
* Statistical functions and analysis;
* Remote sensing data/images applications;
* Others.

The featured `JavaScript` applications are:

1) [GEE Images Download](./gee-image-download "gee-image-download applications"), a folder with applications to easily download OLI an MSI data from GEE console;

2) [GEE Vegetation Classify](./gee-vegetation-classify "vegetation-classify application"), a application for GEE console that applies a vegetation classification over a given region of interest and date period;

## Installation - Requirements

To copy all scripts of this **Portfolio** open the GEE console (www.code.earthengine.google.com) and simply copy each code you need to a new file in some of your repositories. Or follow the code description inside each folder with the link to the public code on GEE.

## Examples of Use

To see the scripts running and learn how to use them, the user can follow the examples inside each code folder.
